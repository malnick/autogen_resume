##SUDO Make me a Resume
Because I hate making yet another resume for yet another job. 

##Action
	./autogen.sh www.your.job.description.com

##How it works
wget the job description, compare to dictionary of verbs and adverbs that I commonly refernce in my resume. Insert the adverbs that match my dictionary of commonly used verbs to the job description and fill in my resume template with the correct adverbs/verbs. 


##Fork it?
Make it your own and fork it!

Anyone who has machine learning skills could probably make this a pretty neat resume web-app!
